# Mask from the difference of images
Based on two images, calculates the image mask that must be applied over the original image to get the desired image.
# Example
### Original image
![Original image](test/original.png)
### Image with mask (the filter generated by the neural network)
![Image with mask](test/AI_generated.png)
### Image mask
